I downloaded my data from this link https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/southampton_england/
the file was sized about 66.2 MB and named southampton.osm

The reason for my choice
i was looking for a city that was not big, and where english is the official language so i can avoid special characters and not block my computer with too much data processing .
